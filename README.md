# JavaScript Scramble Game

A simple and fun word scramble game built using vanilla JavaScript. In each round, players try to guess a scrambled programming-related word based on a provided hint. The game tracks the score and ends after 10 rounds or if the player cancels.

## How to Play

- The game runs in the browser using prompt() and alert().
- Youâ€™ll be shown a scrambled word and a hint.
- Type your guess into the prompt box.
- Correct guesses increase your score by 10 points.
- Incorrect guesses decrease your score by 5 points.
- The game ends after 10 rounds or if you cancel early.

## JavaScript Constructs Used

This project demonstrates usage of the following JavaScript fundamentals:

- **Arrays**: Used to store the list of word-hint pairs.
- **Objects**: Each word and its hint are stored as key-value pairs.
- **Functions**: functions like shuffleArray() and scramble().
- **Loops**: for loop is used to iterate over game rounds.
- Conditionals: **if**, else, and **while** statements.
- String Methods: **.split()**, **.join()**, **.toLowerCase()**.
- Array Methods: **.sort()**.
- Interacts with the user through **prompt()** and **alert()**.
